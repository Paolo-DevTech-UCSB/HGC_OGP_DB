# OGP Station
Intended to be installed on the OGP computer. Running this program processes and uploads OGP survey outputs of components/modules to the local database. The GUI allows the user to view plots of the data and upload new files.

## Getting started
In Python 3.6 or greater on the OGP computer: 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cmu-hgc-mac/HGC_OGP_DB.git
```

1. Make sure the .yaml file on the OGP computer is up to date with the correct database name.
2. Save the location of the **watch directory**  in the .yaml file.
3. As the OGP user, please have access to the OGP database password.

## Starting a GUI instance (will be moved into a config file)
```
cd read-write-ogp
python3 file_selector.py
```

## How to use:
This GUI contains two tabs: 'View Plots' and 'Upload Files'.
- View plots shows plots data from the OGP. (TBD: Change limit on number of files)
- Upload Files lets the user upload .XLS output files containing OGP meaurements to the local db.
  - The **watch directory** _must contain_ the following subdirectories for the GUI to work:
    - baseplates
    - hexaboards
    - protomodules
    - modules
  - The OGP inspection files _must be configured to write to these locations_ by default type.
    - The .XLS files must be saved with the ID of the component and will be used as the part ID in the db.

## How this works (for developers)
- [```file_selector.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/file_selector.py) runs the GUI instance
- Code for reading/writing from local db are in [```postgres_tools/upload_inspect.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/postgres_tools/upload_inspect.py).
- The 'Upload Files' tab calls [```process_im.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/process_im.py) to process data by module type.
- The processing itself happens in [```ogp_height_plotter.py```](https://github.com/murthysindhu/HGC_DB_postgres/blob/main/read-write-ogp/ogp_height_plotter.py) to process data by module type.

## To create a watcher instance (will be moved into a config file)
(To ber combined with file_selector GUI)
```
cd read-write-ogp
python3 auto_upload.py
```

## Using pgAdmin4 to view tables (Instructions to follow)
Install [postgreSQL-15 with pgAdmin4](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your computers. Make sure you add ```psql``` to your path.
